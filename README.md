# zPermissions &mdash; A Superperms plugin for Bukkit #

zPermissions is primarily an SQL database-backed Superperms (aka Bukkit permissions) implementation. It also supports flat-file storage. Notable features are: multi-world support, ranks with multiple tracks/ladders, group inheritance of arbitrary depth (within reason), and optional region-specific permissions using [WorldGuard](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/worldguard/) regions, [Residence](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/residence/) residences, [Factions](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/factions/) territories, or [Factoid](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/factoid/) lands.

There is no built-in build protection (I rely on other plugins for that). zPermissions focuses on permissions and only permissions.

I aim to keep zPermissions a simple, yet feature-rich, Superperms provider.

## Features ##

*   **A variety of storage options, from SQL to flat-file.** Uses Bukkit database to store permissions (i.e. settings in bukkit.yml). Should work with most databases supported by [Avaje Ebean](http://www.avaje.org) &mdash; I've specifically tested with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and H2. The default Bukkit database, SQLite, is **not** supported. zPermissions will automatically fall back to flat-file storage if it is used.

*   **Group inheritance.** Groups may inherit permissions from a multiple parent groups.

*   **Players may be members of more than one group.** The order of which group permissions are applied is well defined and based on group weight (which is configurable, of course).

*   **Multi-world support.** Permissions granted to players and groups may be associated with a specific world.

*   **Optional region support.** Permissions may also be associated with WorldGuard regions or Residence residences.

*   **Multiple promotion tracks!** Using permissions, you can also limit who can promote/demote others and which tracks they may use. In addition, each player may be promoted/demoted along multiple tracks.

*   **Short-term temporary permissions.** Give a player a permission node that lasts anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes.

*   **Temporary group assignments.** Assign a group to a player and have their membership expire after 1 day... a few months... or a year! Whatever duration you want.

*   **Players and groups can be assigned chat prefixes and suffixes.** A Vault-compatible chat-formatting plugin is still required, like [Herochat](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/herochat/), [zChat](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/zchat/), etc.

*   **API.** zPermissions offers a comprehensive *read-only* API that other plugins can use. (Though I would recommend coding against [Vault](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/vault/) instead.)

*   **Metadata support.** Players and groups may have arbitrary metadata associated with them. Metadata values may be strings, integers, reals (floating point), and booleans. Metadata may be queried via the native API or Vault Chat API.

*   **Automatic group permissions.** With the advent of Superperms/Bukkit permissions, the recommended way of testing group membership is by using permissions. zPermissions can automatically set a permission based on the group's name for each group. By default, this configurable permission is `group.<groupname>` (compatible out-of-the-box with WorldEdit and WorldGuard!).

*   **Re-assignable default group.** The default group (the group assigned to players who have not been explicitly placed into any groups) is named `default`. This may be changed.

## Concepts ##

*   Groups are "universal" &mdash; across all worlds. There are no plans to introduce world-specific groups.

*   However, players and groups may have world-specific and/or region-specific permissions. These permissions are only in effect when the player is in that particular world and/or region.

*   There are 4 "levels" of permissions: universal, world-specific, region-specific, and finally region- and world-specific. The most general permissions are applied first, with all group permissions applied first finally followed by player permissions:
     1. Universal group permissions
     2. World-specific group permissions
     3. Region-specific group permissions
     4. Region- and world-specific group permissions
     5. Universal player permissions
     6. World-specific player permissions
     7. Region-specific player permissions
     8. Region- and world-specific player permissions

*   Players may be members of multiple groups. Groups may be assigned a weight &mdash; a higher weight means the group is applied later so it overrides earlier groups. Groups with the same weight are applied alphabetically.

*   Groups may inherit from one or more parent groups. A group's parents are applied in *reverse* order so that a group's first parent overrides all subsequent parents.

## Installation & Usage ##

Put zPermissions.jar in your server's `plugins` directory. Start up your server. This will create the file `config.yml` in your server's `plugins/zPermissions` directory. You may want to edit this file to set your default group and default track. You may also want to create your tracks.

Type `/permissions` to get started. (`/perm` or `/p` may also work, if those aliases are available.)

The permission nodes in the `get`, `set`, and `unset` sub-commands may be specified as:

*   &lt;permission> &mdash; An unqualified permission node applies to all worlds and all regions.
*   &lt;world>:&lt;permission> &mdash; To make a permission world-specific, prefix it with the world name followed by a colon.
*   &lt;region>/&lt;permission> &mdash; To make a permission region-specific, prefix it with the region name followed by a slash.
*   &lt;region>/&lt;world>:&lt;permission> &mdash; You may also make a permission both region- and world-specific by combining the two qualifiers. For now, the region qualifier must always come first.

The rank commands are `/promote`, `/demote`, `/setrank`, and `/unsetrank` and will normally broadcast changes to all admins. The rank commands have an option `-q` to operate silently, e.g. when being called by automated processes. They will, however, still log their actions to the server log for security audit purposes. Opposite of `-q`, they will also take `-Q` which causes the rank commands to broadcast changes to all users.
